# ML-Training
Basic ML projects.

## Current plan:
1. Basic MINST AI using Tensorflow
2. Basic MINST using Numpy only
3. Basic MINST with CNN and using Tensorflow
4. Comparisone of data

## Dense layer study
This simple study is focused on understanding effect of number of elements for hidden dense layer on the accuracy of model for a MNIST dataset. Two types of models were studied, first one being one hidden layer model, for both ReLU and Softmax activation functions for hidden layer. Second model had two hidden layers, both using ReLU activation function. Models used come from TensorFlow Keras.
