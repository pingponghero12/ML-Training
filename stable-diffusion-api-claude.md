You're looking for a way to interact with Stable Diffusion programmatically rather than through a graphical interface. This is certainly possible, and there are a few ways to approach it. Let me outline some options:

1. Stable Diffusion with Python API:
   You can install Stable Diffusion directly and use its Python API. This allows you to run Stable Diffusion locally and send prompts programmatically.

   Steps:
   - Install Python and necessary dependencies
   - Clone the Stable Diffusion repository
   - Download the model weights
   - Use the Python API to generate images

2. Diffusers Library:
   Hugging Face's Diffusers library provides a simple way to use Stable Diffusion and other diffusion models.

   Steps:
   - Install the diffusers library: `pip install diffusers transformers`
   - Use the library to load the model and generate images

3. API Services:
   Some services offer API access to Stable Diffusion, which you can interact with using HTTP requests.

4. Docker containers:
   There are Docker images available that package Stable Diffusion with an API, allowing you to run it as a service.

Regarding Ollama:
Ollama is primarily designed for running large language models (LLMs) locally, not for image generation. While it's an excellent tool for text-based AI, it doesn't natively support Stable Diffusion or other image generation models.

For your specific use case of sending prompts to a port and receiving images, I'd recommend setting up a local API server using one of the above methods. The Python API or Diffusers library would be good starting points.

Here's a basic example using the Diffusers library:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("astronaut_rides_horse.png")
```

You could wrap this in a simple API server using a framework like Flask or FastAPI, allowing you to send prompts to a specific port and receive images in response.

Would you like me to provide more details on any of these approaches or help you get started with a specific method?
